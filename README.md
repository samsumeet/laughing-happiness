# Getting Started

### Guide

* To run this project you need to install Java 8 and Maven. You can find it here (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

* After installing maven you can run below command to run the project:
	> cd repaymentapi
	> mvn clean install
	
	> java -jar target/RepaymentAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	or
	> mvn spring-boot:run	

* Now after running the application you can view the api documentation also here(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).	
   I have used Swagger UI so that we can also test our API using Web GUI.

 						
 		#### Technology And Framework Used

* I have used Java 8 and SpringBoot Framework  for building Restfull API.
* This framework is very robust and scalable as well its's up to date with latest technologies.
* It provides very good support for maximum third party libraries out of the box, so ts very easy to integrate them.

  		#### Test Cases
 I have written simple test case's to just show how we can write them . We can write comprehensive test cases for starting from boilerplate code.
